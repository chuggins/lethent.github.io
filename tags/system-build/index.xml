      <description>Several years after building my home Network Attached Storage (NAS) server, I was spending a lot of time thinking about backups. The ZFS file system running in a RAID-Z2 configuration ensures that it would require 3 disk failures to loose data. However, as has been written about at great length across the Internet, RAID is not equivalent to a backup. Even with disk redundancy you are at risk of system failures, bugs destroying data, floods, fires, and good old fashioned operator error.</description>
